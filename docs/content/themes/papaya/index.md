# Papaya

A clean [Zola](https://getzola.org) theme for blogging and projects, forked from [Anpu](https://github.com/zbrox/anpu-zola-theme).

**Demo site**: [https://justintennant.me/papaya/](https://justintennant.me/papaya/)

## Features

- Blog posts

- Featured images for posts/pages
- Smart image embedding shortcode (`{{/* img() */}}`)
- GitHub repository star/fork counts
- [Open Graph Protocol](https://ogp.me/) tags

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your `themes` folder:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/justint/papaya.git themes/papaya
    ```

2. Set your theme setting in `config.toml` to `papaya`:

    ```toml
    theme = "papaya"
    ```

3. This theme requires both the `tags` and `categories` taxonomies.

    ```toml
    taxonomies = [
        { name = "categories" },
        { name = "tags" },
    ]
    ```
4. In your `content` directory, add new `blog` and `projects` directories. Copy the `_index.md` file from Papaya's `content/blog` into your `content/blog`, and the `_index.md` and `categories.json` files from Papaya's `content/projects` into your `content/projects`.
   
   Your `content` directory structure should look like this:
   ```
   content
   â”œâ”€â”€ blog
   â”‚  â””â”€â”€ _index.md
   â””â”€â”€ projects
      â””â”€â”€ _index.md
      â””â”€â”€ categories.json
   ```
   
5. _(optional)_ To enable GitHub repository stars/fork counts (disabled by default to avoid hitting API rate limits), set the `$ZOLA_ENV` environment variable to `prod` prior to your `zola serve`/`zola build` execution.
   
   For csh/tsch:
   ```shell
   setenv ZOLA_ENV prod
   ```
   
   For bash/ksh/zsh:
   ```shell
   export ZOLA_ENV=prod
   ```

## Customization

Here are the customizable features of Papaya: 

- Navigation menu links
- Post/project date formats
- Post/project featured images
- Project categories
- Open Graph Protocol locale/profile information
- Social/contact links

### Navigation menu links

In your `config.toml` under the `[extra]` section you need to set the `papaya_menu_links` list.

Example:

```toml
[extra]
papaya_menu_links = [
    { url = "$BASE_URL/about/", name = "About" },
]
```

If you include `$BASE_URL` in the URL of a link it will be replaced with the base URL of your site.

### Post/project date formats

In your `config.toml` under the `[extra]` section you need to set the `papaya_date_format` value.

Example:

```toml
[extra]
papaya_date_format = "%e %B %Y"
```

The formatting uses the standard `date` filter in Tera. The date format options you can use are listed in the [chrono crate documentation](https://tera.netlify.app/docs/#date).

### Post/project featured images

Posts and projects can have featured images which display at the top of their page before the page contents.

```toml
[extra]
featured_image = "image.jpg"
featured_image_alt = "A lodge overlooks a forested mountain range."
```

![Featured image](pics/featured_image.png)

Featured images can also be extended to the full width of the viewport:

```toml
[extra]
featured_image = "image.jpg"
featured_image_alt = "A lodge overlooks a forested mountain range."
featured_image_extended = true
```

![Featured image, extended](pics/featured_image_extended.png)


### Project categories

In your `content/projects/categories.json`, you can specify the categories of projects. The formatting of the file is:

```json
{
   "title": "keyword"
}
```

- `"title"`: the title text displayed for each category grouping on your projects page.
- `"keyword"`: the taxonomy term you'll use in your project pages.

A project can have multiple categories, and will be displayed once in each category configured.

Projects without categories will be displayed in the "Other" category listing of your project page. If you don't want the "Other" category displayed, you can copy the `templates/projects.html` to your own `templates` directory and delete/comment out the "Other" category code.

Example `categories.json`:

```json
{
  "Software": "software",
  "Films": "film"
}
```

Example project page front matter:
```toml
title = "Example software project"
date = 2021-08-11

[taxonomies]
categories = ["software"]
```

The example project page above would be grouped into & displayed within the "Software" category of your projects page.

### Open Graph Protocol locale/profile information

In your `config.toml` you can add a `[extra.ogp]` section to specify your Open Graph Protocol locale and profile information.

Open Graph Protocol provides you control over how your website's content should be displayed on social media sites. 

For the more information on Open Graph Protocol and valid property values, visit the official [website](https://ogp.me/). 

Example:

```toml
[extra.ogp]
locale = "en_US"
first_name = "Papaya"
last_name = "Tiliqua"
gender = "female"
username = "tiliquasp"
```

### Social/contact links

In your `config.toml` you can add a `[extra.social]` section to specify your social network/contact accounts. Changing these will update what links appear on your website's footer.

Example:

```toml
[extra.social]
email = "papaya@tiliqua.sp"
github = "papaya"
linkedin = "papayatiliqua"
```

## Image embedding shortcode

Included with Papaya is a shortcode for embedding images into your posts:

```
img(path, alt, caption, class, extended_width_pct)
```

### Arguments

- `path`: The path to the image relative to the `content` directory in the [directory structure](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/directory-structure/).
- `alt`: _(optional)_ The alternate text for the image.
- `caption`: _(optional)_ A caption for the image. Text/HTML/Tera templates supported.
- `class`: _(optional)_ Any CSS classes to assign to the image. Multiple classes should be separated with a space (`" "`).
- `extended_width_pct`: _(optional)_ The percentage by which the image's width should be expanded past it's default figure width, up to maximum configured pixel width. 

   Range is `0.0-1.0`, or `-1` for document width. 

   Max pixel width can be defined in your `config.toml`  with the `extra.images.max_width` property (2500px default).

   See [Extended width images](#extended-width-images) section for more details and examples.

The benefits of using this shortcode over regular Markdown/HTML image embedding are:

- Images are automatically resized for best performance, using Zola's [image processing functions](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/image-processing/)
- Images & captions are âœ¨pre-styledâœ¨ for you
- Images can have their width extended past the document's width (see: [Extended width images](#extended-width-images))
- Less HTML/CSS boilerplate to write


### Extended width images

Images embedded into pages using the `img` shortcode can be configured to extend past their document width. This is especially nice for displaying wide/landscape images at higher resolutions.

By default, images embedded with the `img` shortcode will be inserted as a `figure` with default margins:

```js
{{/* img(path="image.jpg", 
       alt="A very cute leopard gecko.", 
       caption="A very cute leopard gecko. Default sizing.") */}}
```

![Default sized image](pics/img_default.png)

With the `extended_width_pct` argument, we can specify a percentage of how much the image should expand outside its default figure width, up to your maximum configured image width (`config.extras.images.max_width`, 2500px default).

Here's an example with `extended_width_pct=0.1`:

```js
{{/* img(path="image.jpg", 
       alt="A very cute leopard gecko.", 
       caption="A very cute leopard gecko. extended_width_pct=0.1",
       extended_width_pct=0.1) */}}
```

![Image extended by 0.1](pics/img_0.1.png)

The image is now displayed with a 10% larger width, while maintaining its original aspect ratio.

Here's an even wider example:

```js
{{/* img(path="image.jpg", 
       alt="A very cute leopard gecko.", 
       caption="A very cute leopard gecko. extended_width_pct=0.2",
       extended_width_pct=0.2) */}}
```

![Image extended by 0.2](pics/img_0.2.png)

The images will resize in resolution up to your maximum configured image width, and will display on the webpage up to the maximum width of the viewport.

You can also force the image width to match the document's width by setting `extended_width_pct` to `-1`:

```js
{{/* img(path="image.jpg", 
       alt="A very cute leopard gecko.", 
       caption="A very cute leopard gecko. extended_width_pct=-1",
       extended_width_pct=-1) */}}
```
